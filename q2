A.  Explain what recursion is and when it is useful.
        Answer) Recursion is when a method calls itself and it is useful when we need to make binary tree 
                or when we need to call the method it self
    Explain what the |termination step| and |recursion step| are in a recursive method.
        Answer) Termination step is when the method stops calling itself when recursion meet certain conditions.
                Recursion step is a step that calls itself to get the certain condition that I want to see.

B.  Describe the difference between a Queue and a Stack.
        Answer) Queue and stack are linear structure of links but Queue is FIFO(first in first out) 
        which the new linke goes to the first and the old one is removed and the new thing becomes as a head,
        and stack is LIFO(last in first out) which the new link which goes in goes to the last 
        and the first one which was head is moved to the last one.

C.  Write a class for an element of a doublely-linked list.
        Answer)public class DLnkList{
  
                  private DLnk head = new DLnk();
                  public int length = 0;
                  
                  public DLnkList(){}
                  
                  public void addDLnk(DLnk newlink){
                    newlink.setNext(this.head);
                    this.head.setPrev(newlink);
                    this.head=newlink;
                    length=length + 1;}
                
                  public DLnk getiLnk(int i){
                    DLnk it = this.head;
                    while(i>0){
                      it=it.getNext();
                      i=i-1;}
                    return it;}
                  
                  public void removeHead(){
                    this.head=this.head.getNext();
                    this.head.setPrev(null);
                    length = length -1;}
                  
                  public DLnk getHead(){
                    return this.head;}
                   
                }

D.  Explain what a Merkle Tree is.  
        Answer) Merkle tree is one of binary tree in which every non-leaf node is labelled 
                with the hash of the labels or values (in case of leaves) of its child nodes.
    Describe the structure and purpose of a Merkle Tree.
        Answer) Merkle trees are useful because they allow efficient and
                secure verification of the contents of large data structures.
                The base of the tree is unhashed data which are leaves, and it grows further and further.
                The leaves have pairs and those pairs which are children compose the tree.
    What is the Merkle root?
        Answer) Merkle root is an element that exists on top of the tree.
    What is the function of a certificate in this data structure?
        Answer) The function of a certificate is with binary system. 
                The number of leaves is 2 to the power of n
